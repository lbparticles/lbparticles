# Summary

The `lbparticles` python package is a tool to model semianalytic orbits of point mass particles in a central potential at a galaxy scale. The model conserves linear and angular momentum where numerical integration methods would not due to numerical inaccuracies. The model has a faster computation speed than integration methods due to approximate analytical equations. The package is built upon Lynden-Bell's previous work '@LyndenBound2015:2015'

The lbparticles package allows for the investigation into population dynamics of interstellar objects. 

Are there similar projects in the past? Is this competely new application?

This paper describes the lbparticles package, the available classes, and the underlying architecture.

# Statement of Intent - lbparticles Package

The lbparticles is a python package that can calculate semianalytic orbits and handle 'accounting' and can be easily integrated into a python project ...

example code can be found @ ...

The lbparticles is designed for interstellar object research...

# Classes

How do the classes of the lbparticles operate?

# Design Principles

We have chosen to construct lbparticles for accessability ...

This is important for python, because it's a language built with object oriented coding in mind...

The lbparticles package is supported by the University of Canterbury interstellar objects working group ...
